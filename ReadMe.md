# Indian Railways System Migration to AWS Cloud

Referring to the Presentation File and the Report file for this project is highly recommended to fully understand the idea behind this.

## Overview

This project outlines the **migration of the Indian Railways System (IRS)** from a traditional on-premises infrastructure to a **scalable, secure, and cost-efficient AWS Cloud platform**. Indian Railways, being one of the largest railway networks in the world, faces increasing demand, performance bottlenecks, and security risks. This migration aims to modernize its IT backbone by leveraging AWS services to handle massive workloads with real-time processing, advanced analytics, and improved disaster recovery.

## Key Features & Functionalities

- **Real-Time Ticketing** with secure transactions and fraud detection  
- **AI-Powered Scheduling** to reduce delays and optimize train routes  
- **Smart Freight Management** using demand forecasting and tracking  
- **Real-Time GPS Tracking** for trains  
- **Predictive Analytics** for operational efficiency  
- **Cloud-Based Secure Data Management** with encryption and backups

## Architecture

### Pre-Migration (On-Premises)

- Centralized data centers (Secunderabad, Gurugram)
- High latency and limited scalability
- Operational inefficiencies and high CapEx

### Post-Migration (AWS Cloud)

- **Compute**: EC2, Lambda  
- **Database**: Amazon RDS, DynamoDB  
- **Storage**: Amazon S3, Glacier  
- **Networking & CDN**: VPC, CloudFront  
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch  
- **Security**: IAM, AWS WAF, AWS Shield  
- **Migration Tools**: AWS DMS, SMS, Snowball, Migration Hub

## Migration Strategy

**Which of the 6 Rs of AWS Migration?**:
- **Rehost** (quick lift and shift)
- **Replatform** (optimize core services)
- **Refactor** (for future scalability)

### Migration Phases

1. Discovery & Inventory  
2. Assessment & Planning  
3. AWS Environment Setup  
4. Data & Application Migration  
5. Testing & Validation  
6. Optimization & Performance Tuning  
7. Security & Compliance Setup  
8. Training & Knowledge Transfer  
9. Go-Live & Post-Migration Support

## Resource Consumption

### Bandwidth

- **Access Layer**: STM-4 (625 Mbps)  
- **Edge Layer**: STM-16 / STM-64  
- **Backbone**: DWDM, 10+ Gbps links

### Storage

- Edge and centralized data centers  
- AWS S3 + Glacier for optimized storage cost

### Compute

- Auto-scaling and serverless compute for high availability  
- Predictive analytics via AWS AI/ML services  

---

## Security & Compliance

- Defense-in-depth approach (IAM, VPC, WAF, KMS)  
- Multi-AZ deployment, Cross-Region replication  
- GDPR-like data protection for PII  
- Compliance tracking using AWS CloudTrail & Config

## Cost Analysis

### Before Migration (On-Prem)

- High infrastructure costs (CapEx)  
- High personnel and maintenance costs  

### During Migration

- Parallel operations  
- Tooling and training costs  

### After Migration (On AWS)

- Pay-as-you-go model  
- Reserved Instances & Auto-Scaling  
- Reduced admin and infra costs

## Conclusion

Migrating IRS to AWS empowers Indian Railways to **scale operations**, **enhance service reliability**, **improve data security**, and **cut infrastructure costs**, enabling future-ready digital transformation for one of the largest public transport systems in the world.
